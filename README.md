# A basis for the primitive elements by counting symmetric chains

Consider a simple matroid $$\mathcal{M}$$, and let 
```math
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{M}}$$ its lattice of flats. Consider $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{L}
```math
its lattice of flats. Consider $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{L}$ containing $E$ a building set, and define $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$ as the set of $\mathcal{G}$-nested sets.
    The Chow ring $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$ is defined as
    \[ \mathcal{A}( \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G}) := \frac{\mathbb{Z}[x_F]_{F \in \mathcal{G}}}{I + J},\]
    where $I$ is the ideal generated by the elements
    \[x_{F_1} \cdots x_{F_l}\] for $\{x_{F_1}, \dots , x_{F_l} \} \subset \mathcal{G}$ which are not $\mathcal{G}$-nested set; and $J$ is the ideal generated by elements \[\sum_{a \le F \in \mathcal{G}} x_F\] for every atom $a \in \mathcal{L}$.
    Observe that the Chow ring a graded algebra
    \[ \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G}) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^r A^k.\]

    Feichtner and Yuzvinsky in \cite{Feichtner_2004}, provided a monomial basis for $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$, defined as
    \[ FY := \{ x_{F_1}^{m_1} \cdots x_{F_l}^{m_l} \, : \, N = \{F_1, \dots, F_l \} \text{ is }\mathcal{G} \text{-nested, and } 0 < m_i < m_{N}(F_i) \},\]
    where $m_N(F) = rk(F) - rk(\vee N_{<F}).$ Observe that by defining $FY^k$ as the set of elements of $FY$ of degree $k$, we have that $FY^k$ is a basis for $A^k$.
     
    Angarone, Nathanson and Reiner in \cite{chowringsmatroidspermutation} decomposed $FY$ with symmetric chains and defined a Lefschetz operator 
    $\lambda$, acting on the chains of the symmetric chain decomposition sending an element of the chain in the next one. This map provide injections $ \lambda : FY^k \hookrightarrow FY^{k+1}$.
    
    The goal of this work is to define primitive elements for $\lambda$ and find a basis for them. In the first chapter we introduce symmetric chain decomposition of a poset and a recursive method to construct them. Next we apply this method to fibers of the extended support function, and provide some results and examples to count the number and the lengths of the chains in the symmetric chain decomposition of a fiber.
    In the second chapter we introduce primitive elements for $\lambda$ and we provide a basis for them by using what we proved in the first chapter.
