# A basis for the primitive elements by counting symmetric chains

These are some notes written by me while studying the symmetric chain decomposition of the Feichtner-Yusvisnky monomial basis to find a basis for the primitive elements of the Lefschetz operator.
This were written while I was working on my master thesis but never did it to the final version of my thesis. This task was suggested by my advisor Roberto Pagaria.
